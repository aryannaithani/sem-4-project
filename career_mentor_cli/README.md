# 🎯 AI Career Mentor CLI

A minimal CLI prototype that simulates the reasoning engine of an AI career mentor.  
It analyses your skills, detects gaps relative to your career goal, and uses Gemini AI to generate a personalised learning roadmap.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set your Gemini API key

**Option A — Environment variable (recommended)**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_key_here"
```

**Option B — Edit the source**  
Open `agents/task_generator.py` and replace `"YOUR_KEY_HERE"` with your key.

## 📝 Customising the Data Files

| File                   | What to edit                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `data/user.txt`        | Your name and career goal                 |
| `data/skills.txt`      | Skills you already have (one per line)    |
| `data/projects.txt`    | Projects you've built (one per line)      |
| `data/required_skills.txt` | Skills the target role demands        |
| `data/context.txt`     | Hot industry trends you want reflected    |

---

## 🔌 How It Works (Pipeline)

```
user.txt  ──────────────────────────────────────────────► User Profile
skills.txt + required_skills.txt ──► Skill Gap Detection ► Gaps List
Gaps List + context.txt + projects.txt ──► Gemini LLM ──► Roadmap 🗺️
```

## 🛡️ No API Key? No Problem.

If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set, the system automatically falls back to a built-in static suggestion engine — so the CLI always produces useful output.
